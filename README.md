# Plungerman
Swing around a cityscape as Plungerman! 

# Motivation
After spending some time creating 2D games, I wanted to try my hand with some 3D. There are a few features that I wish to implement:
- Basic movement with WASD and space bar.
- Camera controls following mouse input.
- Shooting a projectile.
- Swinging following a spherical path in 3D space
